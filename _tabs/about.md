#  Samuel Varga (tlsbollei)

> *"May your EDR kick in before reality does."*

Hi — I’m Samuel, going by the handle "tlsbollei". My main area of research are Windows Internals, dissecting user-mode and kernel-land into pieces. I dig into binaries, kernel quirks, and the nasty little tricks attackers (and defenders) use every day. I started researching and building tooling that the community uses (along with competing in CTFs) as a kid, and now I’m splitting my time between offensive research, malware/EDR evasion, and defensive work like DFIR and threat hunting.

I’m currently working at [Fortinet](https://fortinet.com) as a Red Teaming Intern, benchmarking their product suite, finding holes through research and writing cool implants! 


## Cool background!

I started reverse-engineering at 11 when a video-game cheat became my first disassembly and my first, unshakable obsession. This obsession pulled me into the darker, more rigorous corners of information security - malware development. The beauty of mass infection, the choreography of persistence, and the fascinating tradecraft of APTs. Not to cause harm, but to learn the attacker’s grammar so defenders can anticipate and outsmart it.

The world of threat intelligence fascinates me - the very act of hunting down the technical monsters behind a catastrophe resonates with me to the core of my bones. At a young age, I want to feel it - understand how it feels to be attacked - feel the very thrill of the frontline action. That’s why I’ve dabbled with honeypots for quite the while now.

## Things I do 

* **Windows Internals** (user & kernel land): I reverse-engineer APIs, syscalls, drivers and memory layouts to find where defenses break and to design evasive techniques that real EDRs struggle to spot.
* **Malware development & EDR/AV evasion**: I build and test loaders, injection techniques and novel evasion primitives (KittyLoader, rhaastLoader et al.) as research proofs-of-concept to stress detection logic and improve defensive countermeasures.
* **APT emulation & offensive research**: I study attacker tradecraft end-to-end, idolize the technical skill of top-tier APTs, and emulate their methodologies to harden real-world environments.
* **CTF player**: I represent my country, Slovakia, in CTFs, and I also play for top-tier teams such as **ARESx**, **Friendly Maltese Citizens**, placing on the podium on many top tier CTFs and qualifying for on-site finals in Japan, Tunisia, Italy...

## Some things I’ve worked on:

* **Windows research**: I've led research on syscall hook detection and termination for evasion, KPP (PatchGuard) thread termination along with more kernel-land research. I've also researched and published novel methods of syscall hook invocation, [GhostSys](https://github.com/tlsbollei/GhostSys/blob/main/paper/ghostsys.pdf), but generally focusing on general Windows Internals study.
* **EDR/AV bypass PoCs**: Crafted reproducible proofs-of-concept that show how modern mitigations can be sidestepped and how detection logic should evolve in response.
* **Talks & teaching**: I've given talks at some conferences, such as Exclusive Day '25, where I represented Fortinet and showcased Fortinets product suite after thoroughly benchmarking their products for months, deploying custom malware samples in simulated enviroments.
* **Open Source Projects**: Tools like KittyLoader, Sandevistan and other evasion tools, cited by various agencies, such as [UK's National Cyber Security Centre](https://ctoatncsc.substack.com/p/cto-at-ncsc-summary-week-ending-september-a6d), [Risky.biz](https://news.risky.biz/risky-bulletin-most-uk-school-hacks-are-caused-by-their-own-students/), and many more.


Happy reading!
